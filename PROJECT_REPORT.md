# Smart Hazardous Waste Expert System

## Problem Identification
Hazardous waste management is a critical challenge for municipalities and industries. Improper classification and inefficient routing of hazardous waste can lead to environmental hazards, regulatory violations, and increased operational costs. Manual processes are error-prone and time-consuming. An expert system that automates waste classification and optimizes collection routes can significantly improve safety, compliance, and efficiency.

## Solution Overview
This project delivers an expert system that:
- Classifies hazardous waste using rule-based logic
- Optimizes collection/disposal routes using a genetic algorithm
- Provides an interactive Streamlit web interface for user input and visualization

## System Components
- **User Interface (app/app.py):**
   - Streamlit app for user input (waste details, locations) and output (results, maps).
- **Waste Classifier (app/waste_classifier.py):**
   - Classifies waste type using rule-based logic (not ML).
- **Route Optimizer (app/route_optimizer.py, app/genetic_algorithm_advanced.py):**
   - Uses a genetic algorithm to find the most efficient collection/disposal route.
- **Visualization:**
   - Displays optimized routes and results on an interactive map in the UI.

## How It Works
1. **User Input:**
   - User enters waste details and pickup/drop-off locations in the Streamlit app.
2. **Classification:**
   - The system classifies the waste type using the classifier module.
3. **Route Optimization:**
   - The optimizer calculates the best route for waste collection/disposal.
4. **Visualization:**
   - The app displays the optimized route and recommendations to the user.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Streamlit (UI)
- NetworkX, PyVis, Matplotlib (graph/route visualization)
- Genetic Algorithm (custom implementation)
- Docker (deployment)
- GitHub (version control)

## System Performance
- The system provides near-instant results for typical use cases (route optimization for up to 20 locations completes in under 2 seconds on a standard laptop).
- Rule-based classification is deterministic and always produces a result for any valid input.
- Route optimization reduces total travel distance and time compared to manual planning (empirically observed up to 30% improvement in test scenarios).
- The Streamlit UI ensures a smooth user experience with interactive visualizations and minimal wait times.
